The most of the files here are for testing purposes. The flight_loop.py file is what runs on the raspeberry pi. It consists of a picamera, NEO-6M GPS module, and 2 status LEDs. As of now, turning the pi on will run the loop for a pre-determined amount of times and then stop the program. It saves possible images and a file of all the CSV coords. The pictures can then be run through a neural net for further analysis, or just looked at. Ultimatly, there will be a switch on my remote that provides a voltage to one of the GPIO pins that the raspberry pi will sense and run the program.
